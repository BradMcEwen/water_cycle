            <p>The water cycle also called the hydrological cycle, is a fundamental process of nature that ensures that water keeps on moving and circulating within the Earthâ€™s environment. It can be defined as the continuous movement of water from the surface to the cloud and from clouds to the surface. In this process, the water changes its state without changing the total number of water molecules present in it at any state it converts into. </p>
